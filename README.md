# Collaborative editor
Java-Implementation of Collaborative Editor with Spring Boot and WebSocket usage. This editor uses an operation-based conflict-free replicated data type ([CRDT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type)). It means that an editor propagates a state by transmitting only the update operations while all operations are commutative and idempotent.
The implementation includes a client and server sides.    
### Technology stack
* UI (Javascript, SockJS(WebSocket) jQuery, collections.js)
* Backend (SpringBoot, WebSocket, Junit, Mockito)

### Important Notes
The application client side was tested for a desktop version of Google Chrome Version 79.0.3945.130.
